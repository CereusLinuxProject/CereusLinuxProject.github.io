Cereus Linux is a Void Linuxâ€“based distribution specifically designed to provide a more user-friendly experience on the Linux desktop. It aims to combine the technical advantages of its base system with a more approachable and curated user environment.

This project started as a hobby, driven by our needs and differences with Void Linux, and we have put all our effort into making it a robust and reliable system.
